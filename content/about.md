# Assets and resources

The following assets and resources have been used in the creation of this site:

It is used under the conditions of the [MIT](https://github.com/athul/archie/blob/master/LICENSE) license.
- That theme was, in turn, forked from [Ezhil Theme](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil), under [MIT](https://github.com/vividvilla/ezhil/blob/master/LICENSE.md), and inspired by the design of [blog.jse.li](blog.jse.li).
- The site itself is rendered using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).
- The page favicon has been generated using [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/), and includes graphics from the [twemoji](https://github.com/twitter/twemoji) project licensed under [CC-BY 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
